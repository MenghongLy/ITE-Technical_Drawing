# üñºÔ∏è Technical Drawing using C++ (Student Project)

This is a simple technical drawing project made using C++ in my ITE-Y1_Sermester2 . The goal was to practice basic computer graphics for educational purposes as part of my **Technical Drawing** subject.

## üìö About the Project

This project includes simple shapes and diagrams such as lines, circles, and basic structures. It's focused on understanding how drawing works in C++ using the `graphics.h` library.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Library Used

- **Language**: C++
- **Library**: `graphics.h` (using WinBGIm for Windows)

> Note: `graphics.h` is not supported in modern C++ compilers by default. You need to install WinBGIm to run the program.

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install Code::Blocks** (or any IDE that supports WinBGIm)
2. **Set up `graphics.h` and `libbgi.a`** in your compiler
3. **Add these linker options**:
